# CountFiles
A Python script that counts the number of files in a directory. Just paste in the path, and let it do the work! It doesn't count folders, or the files within any sub-folders. Not going to lie: I made this in five minutes, because I was too lazy to count the number of files in a folder I had.

# Usage:

python3 count_files.py -d <directory>

# To Do

1. Add option to count folders

2. Add option to count files in sub-folders

3. Add parameter support
